	  Includes limits, continuity, derivatives, and some applications of derivatives. Graphing technology is required, such as Desmos and/or GeoGebra which are available at not cost. 
	  Audit available.
  </p>
  <p>
	  Addendum: This is the first course of four courses in the Calculus sequence. Students will be required to have physical graphing calculators in MTH 251. Where physically possible, 
	  instructors will demonstrate using Desmos, GeoGebra, or other online programs in class. Assessments requiring the use of a graphing calculator will be done outside of the 
	  proctored exam component.

    <title>Learning Outcomes</title>
    <p>
      Upon completion of the course students should be able to:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
			  Analyze real world scenarios to recognize when derivatives and limits are appropriate, formulate problems about the scenarios, creatively model these scenarios (using
			  technology, if appropriate) in order to solve the problems using multiple approaches, judge if the results are reasonable, and then interpret and clearly communicate
			  the results.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
			  Recognize derivatives and limit-related concepts that are encountered in the real world; understand and be able to communicate the underlying mathematics involved
			  to help another person gain insight into the situation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
			  Work with derivatives and limits in various situations and use correct mathematical terminology, notation, and symbolic processes in order to engage in work, study, and
			  conversation on topics involving derivatives and limits with colleagues in the field of mathematics, science, or engineering.
