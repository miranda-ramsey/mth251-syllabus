      <title>Academic Integrity</title>
      <p>
		  Learning is built on the fundamental qualities of honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. At Oregon Coast Community College, 
		  academic integrity is a shared endeavor characterized by truth, personal responsibility and high academic standards. Any violation 
		  of academic integrity devalues the individual and the community. One important aspect of academic integrity is academic honesty.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		  Violations of academic honesty include:
		  <ul>
			  <li>Plagiarism</li>
			  <li>Collusion/Inappropriate Assistance</li>
			  <li>Cheating</li>
			  <li>Fabrication/Falsification/Alteration</li>
			  <li>Unauthorized Multiple Submission</li>
			  <li>Sabotage and Tampering</li>
		  </ul>
		  A student who violates academic honesty will be subject to disciplinary action according to Student Rights and Responsibilities.
      </p>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-mobile-devices">
      <title>Mobile Communication Devices</title>
      <p>
		  Students are not permitted to operate cell phones or pagers during class or laboratory sessions, as these devices disrupt 
		  learning and teaching activities. Students should use such communication devices only during class breaks outside the classrooms.
		  Discuss exceptions with Instructor. 
      </p>

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-student-rights">
      <title>Student Rights and Responsibilities</title>
      <p>
		  The Student Rights and Responsibilities in the <url href="https://catalog.oregoncoastcc.org/student-handbook">Student Handbook</url> 
		  establishes studentsâ€™ freedom and protections as well as expectations of appropriate behavior and ethical academic work.

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Statement</title>

      <p>
        The use of generative AI and Language Learning Models in this course 
        such as, but not limited to ChatGPT, should be used only if it does not 
        otherwise violate the Academic Integrity Policy of the College. Such 
        violations include turning in work that is not your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this class specifically, while generative AI and language learning 
        models can be useful tools for summarizing and presenting 
		  information, leaning on such tools when you are trying to learn something 
		  yourself, even in ways that seem to be academically honest, can 
        instill a dependency that is really challenging to let go of later. 
        <alert>I highly recommend avoiding the use of tools like ChatGPT, even 
        as a study assistant!</alert> Please ask me for help instead.
