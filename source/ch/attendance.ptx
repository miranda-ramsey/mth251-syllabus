		<title>Attendance Policy</title>
		<p>
			Students are expected to attend all classes in which they are enrolled. Repeated absences will affect a studentâ€™s grade.
			Students are responsible for dropping or withdrawing from registered classes by completing the official drop/withdrawal 
			process. Students who stop attending and who fail to drop or withdraw from a class by the published deadline may earn a 
			grade of F or NP according to the grade system option selected by the Student. Students having excessive absences and 
			who fail to drop or withdraw from a class by the published deadline may earn a grade of F or NP according to the grade 
			system option selected by the Student. Students who fail to attend or stop attending classes and fail to drop those 
			classes by the published drop deadline will be responsible for the associated tuition and fees. Students may not attend 
			classes they are not registered for.
