        <title>Attendance</title>
		<p>
			Attendance and participation are crucial to succeed in a math course. 
			This is a <em>remote, live-streamed class</em>, and class sessions
			will be recorded, but students will still be expected to attend the live
			sessions and participate in discussions and activities. <alert>2% of
			the grade</alert> will be awarded for attending at least 15 <em>non-exam</em>
			class sessions.
			If you must miss class, please email me to let me know, and
			I will work with you to make sure you keep up and that your grade is 
			minimally affected.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Homework</title>
        <p>
			Homework will be administered via <em>Problem Sets</em>, which will include problems from the textbook
			as well as other sources. Problem sets are intended to be written up either by hand or with digital tools (e.g. 
			Microsoft Word or Overleaf). Handwritten work must be scanned or photographed and combined into a single document 
			for submission via CANVAS.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Lab Notebook</title>
        <p>
			In class and group activities will be collected into a lab notebook and submitted for review before both exams.
		</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Quizzes</title>
        <p>
          There will be seven quizzes, each administered on a Thursday at the
          start of class and covering material from the week before. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Quiz Corrections:</em> After your graded quiz is returned, you 
          may redo the quiz in its entirety and submit it as a Quiz Correction.
          Your final grade will be an average of your two submissions, meaning
          you can recover up to half of your missed points by submitting a 
          quiz correction. For example, if you score a 6/10 on a quiz, you may
          upgrade your score to an 8/10 with a quiz correction.

        <title>Midterm Exam</title>
        <p>
			A midterm exam will be given in class during week 6, covering Limits and
			Derivative Rules. There will be an opportunity to recover missed points,
			like with a quiz correction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Final Exam</title>
        <p>
			The cumulative final exam will be given on Tuesday during finals week
			(week 11).

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-grading">
	  <title>Grading Policy</title>
	  <p>It is important that students communicate their process and conclusions in a clear 
	  and conventional manner. Conclusions must be stated in complete sentences or mathematical
	  statements for full credit. For example,</p>
  <me><mrow>\text{The derivative of } f \text{ is}</mrow>
	  <mrow>f'(x) = 3x^2 + 2x</mrow></me>
  <p>is preferable to simply writing <m>3x^2 + 2x</m> as an answer.</p>
  <p>Work will be graded not just on the accuracy of solutions and conclusions, but also on
  the presentation and clarity of the work. An incorrect answer that is communicated with a reasonable
	  presentation of work is more valuable that a correct solution with illogical or unstated reasoning.</p>
  <p>Grades will be entered in CANVAS so that students can easily track their grades.</p>

    <title>Late Work and Make-Up Policy</title>
    <p>
      Mathematics is a subject that builds on itself, so it is crucial that you
      stay on top of your work at the pace of the class. However, I understand
      that life does not always line up with college schedules and deadlines. 
      If you need more time to complete a homework assignment, or if you need 
      to miss class, please contact me (see <xref ref="communication"/>) to
      work out an extension, or another way to make up work.
