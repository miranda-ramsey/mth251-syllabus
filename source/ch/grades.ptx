        <title>Attendance</title>
		<p>
			Attendance and participation are crucial to succeed in a math course. 
			This is a <em>remote, live-streamed class</em>, and class sessions
			will be recorded, but students will still be expected to attend the live
			sessions and participate in discussions and activities. <alert>2% of
			the grade</alert> will be awarded for attending at least 15 <em>non-exam</em>
			class sessions.
			If you must miss class, please email me to let me know, and
			I will work with you to make sure you keep up and that your grade is 
			minimally affected.
			Most weeks you will have a set of homework problems, mostly taken from the textbook, to complete and submit on your own. 
			Paper homework will be due in class on the following Monday.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>ALEKS Homework</title>
        <p>
			Most weeks you will have a set of homework problems assigned on ALEKS. These assignments are due Fridays at midnight.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Workbook Activities</title>
        <p>
			For each class session there is an associated workbook activity. The workbook will be graded based on self-assessments
			submitted before the Midterm and the Final. The workbook comes in an <url href="https://miranda-ramsey.github.io/mth20-workbook/">HTML Format</url> 
			and PDFs will be posted on D2L. It is your responsibility to bring the workbook activities to class, either printed out or in a digital format.
		</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Quizzes</title>
        <p>
          There will be seven quizzes, each administered on a Wednesday at the
          start of class and covering material from the week before. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Quiz Corrections:</em> After your graded quiz is returned, you 
          may redo the quiz in its entirety and submit it as a Quiz Correction.
          Your final grade will be an average of your two submissions, meaning
          you can recover up to half of your missed points by submitting a 
          quiz correction. For example, if you score a 6/10 on a quiz, you may
          upgrade your score to an 8/10 with a quiz correction.

      <li>
        <title>Midterm Exam</title>
        <p>
          There is one Midterm Exam in this class, administered on Wednesday,
          April 30. There will be no calculator allowed on this exam, as all of
          your work will need to be shown by hand. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Practice Midterm:</em> One week before the Midterm, I will
          release a Practice Midterm. Working on it together with your group
          will be one of the Workbook Activities, and you can make sure that
          you are prepared for the exam and support your classmates by 
          preparing together.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Midterm Corrections:</em> After your graded exam is returned, you 
          may redo the exam in its entirety and submit it as a Midterm 
          Correction. Your final grade will be an average of your two 
          submissions, meaning you can recover up to half of your missed points 
          by submitting a Midterm correction. For example, if you score a 74% on 
          the exam, you may upgrade your score to an 87% with a midterm 
          correction.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Final Exam</title>
        <p>
          There is one Final Exam in this class, administered on Wednesday,
          June 11. There will be limited calculator use allowed on this exam.
          Unfortunately, since the Final will be during our last class meeting,
          there is no opportunity for a Final Correction. 
          </p>
          <p>
          <em>Practice Final:</em> One week before the Final, I will release 
          a Practice Final. Working on it together with your group will be one 
          of the Workbook Activities, and you can make sure that you are 
          prepared for the exam and support your classmates by preparing 
          together.

    <title>Late Work and Make-Up Policy</title>
    <p>
      Mathematics is a subject that builds on itself, so it is crucial that you
      stay on top of your work at the pace of the class. However, I understand
      that life does not always line up with college schedules and deadlines. 
      If you need more time to complete a homework assignment, or if you need 
      to miss class, please contact me (see <xref ref="communication"/>) to
      work out an extension, or another way to make up work.
