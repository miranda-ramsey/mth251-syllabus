      I highly encourage you to exchange information with your peers, 
      especially those you are working with in groups, to work together outside
		of class. Email, group chats, Zoom meetings, and Discord servers are all 
		excellent ways to connect and collaborate.

    <title>Instructional Approach</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
      Mathematics has an unfortunate reputation for being a challenging subject that only some people are capable of engaging with. I strongly believe that this is not true, and that more people are capable of mathematics than we give credit to. My goal is to facilitate creativity and discovery, rather than simply dictating facts and procedures to memorize. In my lectures I set out to establish a question that can ground us and give us context for the math we are working with, and through group work students will be encouraged to talk through problems, ask for help, and lift each other up. 
      </p>
    </introduction>
<subsubsection xml:id="subsec-weekly-structure">
  <title>Weekly Structure</title>
  <p>
    To perform best in the class, each week you should:
    <dl>
      <li>
        <title>Read Ahead</title>
        <p>
          Read the textbook material ahead of the days we will be covering it in class, so that you can ask questions and get clarification during lectures and group work.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Do Homework As We Go</title>
        <p>
          Work on the homework throughout the week, rather than waiting until the end of the week. This way, challenging problems can be brought up in class with me or with your group.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <title>Come to Office Hours</title>
        <p>
          Visit me in Office Hours to fill in gaps in your understanding, before they become stressful issues.
