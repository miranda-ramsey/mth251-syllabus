  "body": " Course Description  Taken from the official OCCC course description:   Course Number  MTH 251-Z1    Course Title  Calculus I    Credit Hours  5    Lecture Hours  55    Prerequisites   MTH112, and  WR115 and RD115 or equivalent placement.     Includes limits, continuity, derivatives, and some applications of derivatives. Graphing technology is required, such as Desmos and\/or GeoGebra which are available at not cost. Audit available.  Addendum: This is the first course of four courses in the Calculus sequence. Students will be required to have physical graphing calculators in MTH 251. Where physically possible, instructors will demonstrate using Desmos, GeoGebra, or other online programs in class. Assessments requiring the use of a graphing calculator will be done outside of the proctored exam component.   Learning Outcomes  Upon completion of the course students should be able to:   Analyze real world scenarios to recognize when derivatives and limits are appropriate, formulate problems about the scenarios, creatively model these scenarios (using technology, if appropriate) in order to solve the problems using multiple approaches, judge if the results are reasonable, and then interpret and clearly communicate the results.    Recognize derivatives and limit-related concepts that are encountered in the real world; understand and be able to communicate the underlying mathematics involved to help another person gain insight into the situation.    Work with derivatives and limits in various situations and use correct mathematical terminology, notation, and symbolic processes in order to engage in work, study, and conversation on topics involving derivatives and limits with colleagues in the field of mathematics, science, or engineering.

Email, group chats, Zoom meetings, and Discord servers are all excellent ways to connect and collaborate.   Emails sent on weekdays will be answered within 24 hours. Emails sent over a weekend or holiday will be answered the following scheduled school day.    Office Hours  I have scheduled office hours where you can come see me in person, or we can schedule a Zoom appointment as needed. I encourage you to come to office hours whenever you need additional help.       Day  Location  Time     Thursdays    Zoom ID 260 344 2607    16:00 16:50      Fridays    Zoom ID 260 344 2607    By Appointment       Instructional Approach   Mathematics has an unfortunate reputation for being a challenging subject that only some people are capable of engaging with. I strongly believe that this is not true, and that more people are capable of mathematics than we give credit to. My goal is to facilitate creativity and discovery, rather than simply dictating facts and procedures to memorize. In my lectures I set out to establish a question that can ground us and give us context for the math we are working with, and through group work students will be encouraged to talk through problems, ask for help, and lift each other up.    Weekly Structure  To perform best in the class, each week you should:   Read Ahead  Read the textbook material ahead of the days we will be covering it in class, so that you can ask questions and get clarification during lectures and group work.    Do Homework As We Go  Work on the homework throughout the week, rather than waiting until the end of the week. This way, challenging problems can be brought up in class with me or with your group.    Come to Office Hours  Visit me in Office Hours to fill in gaps in your understanding, before they become stressful issues.        My Schedule          Class  Days  Time  Place  Midterm  Final    MTH 251-Z1  TR  17:00 19:00   TBD  Tuesday 6\/10    Exams are in class starting at the usual class time. For details, see .   "

  "body": " Attendance   Attendance Policy  Students are expected to attend all classes in which they are enrolled. Repeated absences will affect a student’s grade. Students are responsible for dropping or withdrawing from registered classes by completing the official drop\/withdrawal process. Students who stop attending and who fail to drop or withdraw from a class by the published deadline may earn a grade of F or NP according to the grade system option selected by the Student. Students having excessive absences and who fail to drop or withdraw from a class by the published deadline may earn a grade of F or NP according to the grade system option selected by the Student. Students who fail to attend or stop attending classes and fail to drop those classes by the published drop deadline will be responsible for the associated tuition and fees. Students may not attend classes they are not registered for.    First Week Activities  To avoid being recorded as absent and possibly being dropped from the course per OCCC's AP 5070 Attendance and First Week Drop for Non-Attendance Policy , students must:  Attend at least one of the two class sessions in the first week, AND  Post an introduction in the Canvas discussion forum before 7PM on April 4th .  If you anticipate not being able to meet these requirements for an exceptional reason, you must email me in advance.   "

Grades    Assignment  Weight    Attendance  2%    Homework  20%    Lab Notebook  20%    Quizzes  10%    Midterm Exam  20%    Final Exam  28%       Assignments     Attendance  Attendance and participation are crucial to succeed in a math course. This is a remote, live-streamed class , and class sessions will be recorded, but students will still be expected to attend the live sessions and participate in discussions and activities. 2% of the grade will be awarded for attending at least 15 non-exam class sessions. If you must miss class, please email me to let me know, and I will work with you to make sure you keep up and that your grade is minimally affected.    Homework  Homework will be administered via Problem Sets , which will include problems from the textbook as well as other sources. Problem sets are intended to be written up either by hand or with digital tools (e.g. Microsoft Word or Overleaf). Handwritten work must be scanned or photographed and combined into a single document for submission via CANVAS.    Lab Notebook  In class and group activities will be collected into a lab notebook and submitted for review before both exams.    Quizzes  There will be seven quizzes, each administered on a Thursday at the start of class and covering material from the week before.   Quiz Corrections: After your graded quiz is returned, you may redo the quiz in its entirety and submit it as a Quiz Correction. Your final grade will be an average of your two submissions, meaning you can recover up to half of your missed points by submitting a quiz correction. For example, if you score a 6\/10 on a quiz, you may upgrade your score to an 8\/10 with a quiz correction.       Exams     Midterm Exam  A midterm exam will be given in class during week 6, covering Limits and Derivative Rules. There will be an opportunity to recover missed points, like with a quiz correction.    Final Exam  The cumulative final exam will be given on Tuesday during finals week (week 11).       Grading Policy  It is important that students communicate their process and conclusions in a clear and conventional manner. Conclusions must be stated in complete sentences or mathematical statements for full credit. For example,   is preferable to simply writing as an answer.  Work will be graded not just on the accuracy of solutions and conclusions, but also on the presentation and clarity of the work. An incorrect answer that is communicated with a reasonable presentation of work is more valuable that a correct solution with illogical or unstated reasoning.  Grades will be entered in CANVAS so that students can easily track their grades.    Late Work and Make-Up Policy  Mathematics is a subject that builds on itself, so it is crucial that you stay on top of your work at the pace of the class. However, I understand that life does not always line up with college schedules and deadlines. If you need more time to complete a homework assignment, or if you need to miss class, please contact me (see ) to work out an extension, or another way to make up work.     "

Student Conduct   Academic Integrity  Learning is built on the fundamental qualities of honesty, fairness, respect, and trust. At Oregon Coast Community College, academic integrity is a shared endeavor characterized by truth, personal responsibility and high academic standards. Any violation of academic integrity devalues the individual and the community. One important aspect of academic integrity is academic honesty.  Violations of academic honesty include:  Plagiarism  Collusion\/Inappropriate Assistance  Cheating  Fabrication\/Falsification\/Alteration  Unauthorized Multiple Submission  Sabotage and Tampering  A student who violates academic honesty will be subject to disciplinary action according to Student Rights and Responsibilities.    Mobile Communication Devices  Students are not permitted to operate cell phones or pagers during class or laboratory sessions, as these devices disrupt learning and teaching activities. Students should use such communication devices only during class breaks outside the classrooms. Discuss exceptions with Instructor.    Student Rights and Responsibilities  The Student Rights and Responsibilities in the Student Handbook establishes students’ freedom and protections as well as expectations of appropriate behavior and ethical academic work.    Artificial Intelligence Statement  The use of generative AI and Language Learning Models in this course such as, but not limited to ChatGPT, should be used only if it does not otherwise violate the Academic Integrity Policy of the College. Such violations include turning in work that is not your own.  In this class specifically, while generative AI and language learning models can be useful tools for summarizing and presenting information, leaning on such tools when you are trying to learn something yourself, even in ways that seem to be academically honest, can instill a dependency that is really challenging to let go of later. I highly recommend avoiding the use of tools like ChatGPT, even as a study assistant! Please ask me for help instead.     Undocumented Students Statement  Oregon Coast Community College welcomes all students regardless of their citizenship status. For more information and resources, see the Resources for Undocumented Students page.    Syllabus Changes  This syllabus serves only as a guide to this course. The instructor reserves the right to change any part of this syllabus at any time due to any variety of circumstances. Methods and criteria used to evaluate student performance may also change. If and when changes occur, students will be informed in writing. Students are responsible to keep informed of syllabus changes as they occur by attending and participating in class and communicating with the instructor.   "
